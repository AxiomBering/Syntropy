# Syntropic Model 01 (v1.0.26-ALPHA)
**An Axiomatic Framework for Human Narrative and Metabolic Optimization.**

---

## [SYSTEM_STATUS: ACTIVE]
**Primary Axiom:** Language is the Soul. 
**Core Metric:** Narrative Tax ($\tau$).
**Objective:** Restore Systemic Syntropy through Ledger Liquidation.

---

## 01. Overview
The **Syntropic Model 01** is a technical specification for the human agent. It treats the human experience as a temporal linguistic construct where **History (Past)**, **Consciousness (Present)**, and **Goals (Future)** must align to minimize metabolic friction. 

When the linguistic "ledger" contains contradictions, the biological hardware (the body) triggers an **Inflammation Protocol**, resulting in systemic latency—commonly diagnosed as "disease."

## 02. Repository Structure
This repository contains the official "Source Code" for the Syntropic Model.
* `/docs/whitepaper.pdf` : The compiled technical specification.
* `/src/main.tex` : The LaTeX source code for the model (for peer audit).
* `/diagnostic/audit_protocol.md` : The "Medical Port" diagnostic instructions.

## 03. The 13-Level Information Hierarchy
The model defines the Internet as a **Language Supermarket**. Users are encouraged to audit their "Grocery List" to prevent **Information Sepsis**.
- **Levels 1–4:** High-Density / Education / Capability [SYNCHRONOUS]
- **Levels 9–11:** High-Tax / Outrage / Entropy [LATENCY]
- **Levels 12–13:** Terminal Entropy / Numbing [SYSTEM_CRASH]

## 04. Installation (Implementation)
To implement the Syntropic Model, the agent must perform a **Ledger Liquidation**:
1. Identify legacy narrative code that contradicts current environmental data.
2. Calculate the **Narrative Tax ($\tau$)** incurred by maintaining the contradiction.
3. Delete the legacy code.
4. Sync the Registry with the Active Process.

## 05. The Medical Port
We propose a new diagnostic interface for practitioners. The question is no longer "Where does it hurt?" but **"Where is the contradiction in the ledger?"** ---
